## The site 
A personal portfolio website -- the current iteration of the site is broken up into three pages: a home/"about me" page; a portfolio page highlighting (hypothetical) projects; a contact page wherin the user may write & send messages.

## Features (or attemps at them)
Built the site with the intent of using responsive features, so all pages may be viewed on any device regardless of size. This was attempted through the use of Bootstrap's class and layout system. 
    
Based on appreences this seems to operate as intended. However 
i wonder if I relyed on Bootstrap's mechanics too much; more CSS elements could have been included in the layout design possibly improving the code's overall segmentation and scanability.

Using classes /id's psuedo classes were used to include/improve some of the portfolio's accessability.

### Note
The colors in this iteration of the site are really...gross (for lack of a more nuanced term). While color palletes, and well-defined images are important, the primary function (and subsequent display) has been to feature layout and element placement using html & css. What I'm trying to say is, I'm sorrry if all the yellow on the site hurts your eyes. And thanks for understanding!
